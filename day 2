node 'default'{}
default contains all the other nodes that are not assigned jobs or simply not present in our manifest file
(this also means that these nodes are signed by the master and are in the same environment) unsigned nodes are not considered

--------------------------------
notify is more like a handler. 

-------------------------
installing mcollective with puppet will let master intall directly on agents without having to write a pp file

--------------------------------------
if there is more than one pp file in a module, the naming convention is as follows,

class classname::filename {}

eg: 
filename - abc.pp
class - class users::abc{} <-- here users can also be the name of the module.

in init.pp, we dont have to write the classname in the above format. just the class name will be enough
order of execution of pp files is automatically correctly done by puppet itself
